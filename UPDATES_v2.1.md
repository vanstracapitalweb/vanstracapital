# Vanstra Bank Platform Updates - v2.1

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dashboard Balance Update Issue** 🔧
**Problem:** When using the 3-tap balance adjustment feature, the success toast appeared but the balance on the dashboard didn't update.

**Root Cause:** 
- The `VanstraBank.updateUser()` function was missing from the bank-core-v2.js
- Balance was being updated in currentUser but not properly synchronized with localStorage
- UI elements were not refreshed after balance change

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Added `updateUser()` function to bank-core-v2.js API
- ✅ Fixed localStorage synchronization in `handleBalanceAdjustment()`
- ✅ Added explicit DOM element updates after balance change
- ✅ Implemented real-time balance polling in dashboard
- ✅ Balance now updates immediately and displays on the dashboard

**Testing:**
```javascript
// Triple-tap on profile avatar to open balance modal
// Add funds and enter PIN (1234)
// Balance updates immediately in:
// - Balance display section
// - Transaction history
// - Available balance fields
```

### 3. **Real-Time Sync System** 🔄
Implemented a bidirectional real-time sync system that keeps the admin panel and user dashboards synchronized.

**Features:**
- **Live User Updates** - Admin sees instant user balance and status changes
- **Cross-Tab Communication** - Changes sync across browser tabs
- **Balance Notifications** - Admins see user balance changes in real-time
- **Status Monitoring** - Account status changes (freeze, block, etc.) appear instantly

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In realtime-sync.js
VanstraRealtimeSync.watchBalance(userId, (data) => {
    console.log('Balance changed:', data);
});

VanstraRealtimeSync.watchAllUsers((data) => {
    console.log('Users updated:', data.users);
});

VanstraRealtimeSync.startPolling(1000); // Poll every 1 second
```
